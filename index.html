        <p>
            Mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching
            for ways to make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, Mediators have an inner
            flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is
            unfortunately high for the Mediator personality type â€“ but when they find like-minded people to spend their time
            with, the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration.
